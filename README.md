# Traffic_Violation

* This is simple object detection using background subtraction method.
* It detects objects in motion with great accuracy but, it does not help when cars are stationary. There are other drawbacks also, it does not separate cluster of vehicles.
* We are also using mobilenetssd caffee model which is highly accurate detecting several objects, but for it too run on computers with average configuration, we will have to compromise the resolution, and minimize the region of interest.

you can see the output of the current program here
